                    PoliSim is a tool for simulating parliamentary democracy. You can set up a parliament,
                    form coalitions, run elections with different voting systems, and see how outcomes change.
                    It's designed for educational and entertainment purposes to help understand complex political mechanics.

                        <p>
                            Start by setting the <strong>Total Seats</strong> in your parliament. Use the <strong>Presets</strong> to load real-world examples like the Dutch Parliament or US Senate. You can also <strong>Export</strong> your current setup as a JSON or CSV file.

                        <p>
                            Add, remove, and edit political parties. For each party, you can set its name, color, starting number of seats, and ideology. The total allocated seats cannot exceed the parliament's total seats.

                        <p>
                            The hemicycle (semi-circular chart) shows the current composition of the parliament. Each colored segment represents a party's seats. Hover over a segment to see the party's name.

                           Select parties to form a coalition. The builder tracks the total seats of your chosen parties and shows your progress towards key majority thresholds (Simple Majority, 2/3, etc.). Complete scenarios to get achievements!

                            Enter a title for a fictional law and click "Simulate Vote." Parties will vote based on a simplified model of their ideology. The bar chart shows the result and whether the motion passed or failed.

                           Configure and run a national election. Set parameters like <strong>Eligible Voters</strong>, <strong>Voter Turnout</strong>, and an <strong>Electoral Threshold</strong> (the minimum % of votes a party needs to be eligible for seats).

                            <li><strong>Sainte-LaguÃ«:</strong> A method known for producing very proportional results.</li>
                            <li><strong>First-Past-The-Post (FPTP):</strong> In this simulation, this is a winner-takes-all system where the party with the most votes wins all seats.</li>

                        <p>
                           Assign a percentage of the vote to each party. The total cannot exceed 100%; any unassigned percentage is considered "spoiled" votes. Click "Run Election" to see the seat allocation and detailed results on the dashboard.
